## Remember how to connect to an sqlite database?


```python
#connect to the db 'parlgov-development' in the data folder
```

### And select data from the table `view_election`?


```python
#your code here
```

# DON'T FORGET TO CLOSE THE DB CONNECTION WHEN YOU'RE DONE QUERYING!!!!!


```python
#your code to close the connection here
```

Good luck on the code challenge, you'll all do fine


```python

```
